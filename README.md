## Bayesian Statistics: Final Assessment

Author: Shannon Dickson

### Purpose

This repository is a research archive and contains everything you need to run my assignment for the course "Introduction to Bayesian Statistics",  submitted June 2022. 
The PDF file contains my final report. The file manuscript.Rmd contains the script and text.
In order to keep the flow of the manuscript consistent, please do not change the order of the code chunks and text. 
If you are only interested in the code that produces the results, and wish to skip my ramblings, please see the "bayes_assignment_only_code.R".
Otherwise, read through the report from start to finish, and try not to be too judgemental of my Bayesian skills.

All analysis is conducted using R version 4.1.2. So you need to have R and R Studio installed. 

*Note: This repository doubles as my submission to the "Markup Languages 2022" course final deliverables.*
