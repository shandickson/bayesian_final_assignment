	abstract = {Wearable devices equipped with sensors popularly used for health monitoring are capable of accumulating motion data providing objective measures of various physical activity and sleep attributes. Also, smartphone usage has grown to an extent where phones have become an integral part of lifestyle contributing to users’ screen viewing time. Behavior and behavioral attributes of individuals’ personal characteristics are significant components of lifestyle of which sleep, physical activity and screen viewing correspond to the most occupied time throughout the day and among the major lifestyle patterns affecting overall health. This study aims to assess sleep quality and behavioral health from wearables and smartphones using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Real time physical activity and sleep data have been collected from users’ smartwatches. A smartphone application is built to collect real time smartphone usage data. Sleep quality indicator (SleepQual) for assessment of daily sleep quality is calculated using sleep attributes collected from smartwatches. Correlation of SleepQual is evaluated with physical activity attributes and smartphone usage attributes using Pearson’s correlation. Highly correlated attributes along with sleep attributes are used to train the ANFIS model for sleep quality assessment. A novel behavioral health indicator (B. Health) is proposed which is evaluated using real time physical activity, sleep and screen time data. Attributes are ranked on the basis of Pearson’s correlation with B. Health to identify the most important contributors to behavioral health. Top ranked features are selected to train the ANFIS model for behavioral health assessment. Systematic Minority Oversampling Technique has been used for data augmentation. The ANFIS model achieves an accuracy of 91.69\% for sleep quality assessment and 85.79\% for behavioral health assessment.},

	abstract = {Wearable sensors recording different components of peoples’ daily activity are commonly used these days for collecting motion data. These provide objective measures of behavioral components like sleep and physical activity. Smartphones are being used increasingly contributing to users’ screen viewing and hence are capable of providing precise measures of users’ screen time. Disruption in the key lifestyle patterns like sleep, physical activity and screen viewing may result in health impairments as these correspond to the utmost engaged times during the day. This study presents a novel dataset containing attributes of physical activity, sleep, and smartphone-based screen viewing collected from users’ smartphones and smartwatches. The dataset contains real time objective measures of activities of 24 undergraduate students. A sleep quality indicator and a behavioral health indicator namely SleepQual and B.Health respectively are evaluated using the extracted features. The instances are labelled based on the scores of SleepQual and B.Health. We have made the dataset publicly available which opens avenues for researchers to employ various intelligent data analysis techniques in order to develop systems capable of automatically assessing sleep quality and behavioral health using digital data without the need of any self-reporting questionnaires and tools. To provide baseline performance four machine learning classifiers are implemented on the proposed dataset.},
